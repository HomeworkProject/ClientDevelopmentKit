# API-Levels

API-Levels indicate how abstract methods/classes/... are.  
Usually more abstraction means less work for developers using the API.  
  
The lower the number, the higher the abstraction but the lower the possibility of customization.  

# Subsections
  
The subsections of this wiki are named after the API-Level they explain.  
Keep in mind:  
Higher levels may be incomplete since they get less priority.

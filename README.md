## Contributing

If you want to contribute to our project, feel free, to do so via.    
* answering issues

At least for this repository (the server) you can freely do so and open pull requests whenever you think it might help.  
But I highly recommend getting in contact with me before doing so, it may help you and me coordinating code updates.  
(As for the official client repo at [Sebastians repos](https://github.com/spaarmann?tab=repositories), please take a look at his readme to make sure what he would like you to do to help.)
